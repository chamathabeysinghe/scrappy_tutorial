{"content": "<p>Ok, So here it goes These are some of the things which you should know, if you by chance you are looking forward to be a Medical Student!<br>\nYou will be able to use what you learn for the rest of your life<br>\nStudying is satisfying when you know the knowledge will be important long after you\u2019ve finished your exams.<br>\nThis might seem like a fairly trivial point, but it should not be overlooked. The truth for many courses is that you are only really studying in order to pass your exams and once you have managed this the information which you have tried so hard to learn is largely useless to you. This is very much not the case in medicine, with areas of study including anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pharmacology and pathology all being directly applicable in diagnosing, understanding and treating a disease. Not only is this a great incentive to learn the core course material well, in order that you will be a competent doctor, it is also an incentive to go beyond the basic lecture material and satisfy your curiosity about what you have been taught. As a medic this extra detail could one day be put into practice in a clinical situation and could make a crucial difference to a patient. When you are studying medicine you are not just studying for the next exam but taking the first steps on a course of lifelong learning, building your basis of professional knowledge throughout your medical career.</p>", "category": "Higher Education", "title": "Life as a Medical Student: Four things you really have to know", "author": "Giyan Chandima"},

Hence I was able to bring back a lot of experience and exposure which I used at the institute to develop and enrich our programmes,\u201d said Prof. Kapurubandara.<br>\nThe international office at SLIIT values the significance of an increasingly interconnected world. With the goal of introducing internationalization, the international programme at SLIIT places utmost importance in recruiting foreign students and establishing an exchange programme for both staff and students.

Working with the Ministry of Higher Education, Ministry of External Affairs, High Schools and Higher Education Institutes in the SAARC, the institute creates awareness on the programmes at SLIIT.<br>\nAt SLIIT, students are provided with opportunities to enhance knowledge, immersed in an exciting cross-cultural environment.

Collecting the sample is very important so as not to contaminate the evidence. After a sample for a source of DNA is collected, DNA is extracted from the sample. The DNA is then purified and analyzed. The information of the fingerprint is compared with data bases for further confirmation.<br>\nForensic scientists have a high demand worldwide in many areas as follows:<br>\nForensic Scientists: These include forensic professionals working in law enforcement, government, or private forensic laboratories who are responsible for dealing with any number of specific tests and analyses, such as toxicology.<br>\nForensic Pathologists: These include medical examiners and other professionals who oversee autopsies and clinical forensic examinations.<br>\nAssociated Scientists: These include scientific professionals lending their knowledge to forensic science, such as forensic botanists, forensic anthropologists, etc. These scientists apply their knowledge to the forensic science field as to provide investigators with crucial information.<br>\nInterested parties in the said field can obtain further information by visiting www.horioncampus.edu.lk or by contact 0114 365 555 or visit Horizon Campus at Malabe.</p>", "category": "Events", "title": "Horizon Campus now offer Forensic Sciences", "author": "Giyan Chandima"},

{"content": "<p>A daunting task began on the 4th of September 2006. It was quite arduous and was a formidable task undertaken by both Dr. Paul Perera and his son Anushke Perera. A tiny branch of a massive tree began its tiny buds and gradually grew up to be a heavy branch naming herself as Negombo South International School Network, with a mere two-figure staff. It is through the integrity and dedication of the management, the number of students began to grow in leaps and bounds. At present the complement of students are around 1,300 and well qualified and experienced mentors numbering nearly 100. Through our dedicated work and perseverance we have reached the highest standards of education, sports, technology and with massive infrastructure facilities we have grown into a fully fledged international school.<br>\nOur rapid progress was mainly due to the devotion, sacrifice and the endurance of the father of N.S.I.S. Network, Dr. Paul Perera and his son, the Director of NSIS Piliyandala branch, Anushke Perera. It is their tremendous effort that brought the school up to the standard that prevails today. Now we celebrate the 10th anniversary and along with this anniversary we have some spectacular and remarkable achievements to be proud of and some of these events are the \u2018Bana\u2019 preaching, the Sil observations campaign which was meticulously planned and well executed by the management and another important aspect being the \u2018Gava Abhayadana\u2019 campaign.<br>\nFrom my point of view, ours is the only international school which gives the right place for Buddhist activities. As further evidence I should state that the school organised an alms-giving for elders and there was a grandfather who paid a glowing tribute by admitting that he had a poor impression of international schools but NSIS has beyond any doubt, proved to be the best international school and we appreciate these precious words as a compliment that was memorable.<br>\nProceeding further the religious activities of the school and extra-curricular activities like the western music unit has highlighted our standards. The senior and the junior western bands have been very prominent and extravagant at sports meets, concerts and during many other special occasions. The school choir is organised and well trained with students of high versatility.<br>\nIt is our school choir that participated in the annual \u2018Bakthi Gee\u2019 2016. They contributed themselves whole-heartedly with the orchestra. Apart from these the announcing unit which was founded in the year 2012 under the guidance of our administratrix Mrs. Menuka Perera and has now become a successful announcing team with more than 40 well trained students making the daily announcements. On this adventurous journey the contribution of our debating society was inexplicable. Many talented students in Grade 5,6,7,8,9 and 10 who were well versed in their English took part-in the activities of the Debating Society.<br>\nIn 2015 a selected group of students took part in a friendly debate with Musaeus College of Colombo under the topic of \u201cEuthanasia\u2019 and gained a very good knowledge in the art of debating. There are associations such as New Inventors Association, Astronomical Society etc. The young inventors from Grade 7 to 11 have made us proud by introducing many inventions, which includes a mini robot, water rockets, touch sensitive alarms etc. And our Astronomical Society had also performed quite credibly and giving us an opportunity to elaborate on our school\u2019s performance.<br>\nThere was a sky observation night camp organised for the first time in our school by the Old Nalandians. Our school astronomical team won the water rocket competition organised by the Nalanda College against many schools in Colombo thus gaining pride and honour, that was totally bestowed upon NSIS. The participants of the NSIS athletes, took part in many zonal, provincial, divisional and all-island competitions. We are the champions in Netball, Cricket, Chess, Gymnastic, Badminton, Aerobics, Karate, Basketball etc. The participants have won many accolades proving NSIS is a unique international school with fame and glory. The work done in improving the fluency of English language by the English Literary Association is of paramount importance. It has done a great job in making students familiar with English Language. In spite of the 10th anniversary of the school, the management had organised an overnight pirith chanting ceremony once again by giving leadership to religious activities.<br>\nThen came the hardest challenge for the Head Mistress Mrs. Enid Goonawardane. She had to raise funds for the prize-giving. Special fund raising activities such as fairs, food fiestas, raffle draws etc. were conducted and the prize-giving was held with pomp and pageantry on the 7th of October 2016. This prize-giving truly displayed the aesthetic skills of NSIS teachers as the welcome song written by Mrs. Achini Fernando and the melody together with the training by music teacher Mrs. Dinali Fernando and calling it \u201cI\u2019m flying\u201d sung by the choir and the music provided by the orchestra. We would like to thank the teachers who organised, wrote and trained the participants of the drama called \u201c The Test\u201d which enlightened the prize-giving and made it a great success. The contributions of grade 9,10,11 students are greatly appreciated.<br>\nThere were also special awards for the best senior prefect and that was won by Kethmi Himasha of Grade 11, The award for the best junior prefect was won by Sandini Gihansa of Grade 9. The award for the academic excellence of junior was Chamathka Sandew Grade 4, secondary Lakshitha Ranawaka of Grade 6. Seniors were Sandini Gihansa of Grade 9 and Ayani Kiriela of Grade 10. Next was the award for the best all rounder being Anjula Pragathi of Grade 10 and we offer our heartiest compliments for all the winners.<br>\nWe thank the souvenir committee of NSIS for expressing their gratitude towards the prize-giving and Dr. Paul Perera for the accepting generous invitation as the chief guest and for Anushke Perera for being the special guest. We also thank the administratrix Mrs. Menuka Perera, the upper section head mistress Mrs. Enid Goonawardena, Lower Section Head Mistress Mrs. S.A.D. Vinitha Piyaseeli who were the pillars behind the prize-giving.<br>\nMrs. Achini Fernando, Mrs. Anuja Yapa, Mrs. Kaushalya Weerasinghe and Mrs. Chintha Didangoda who made an untiring effort to witness an extremely successful prize-giving. We do wish to thank all the teaching staff for their active participation and their diligent efforts are well appreciated. We do also like to offer our special thanks to the prefects\u2019 guild and all the students of the school and all the parents parents who raised funds and for their enormous gratitude shown towards the school. We also thank the companies of Munchee and Fonterra who sponsored our refreshments. The Commercial Bank for their trustworthy sponsoring of commercial activities. The People of the press for their hard work and support to print out souvenirs and photographers of \u201cB ONE\u201d for their artistic choreography.<br>\nIn a praiseworthy note to appreciate the offering of tributes the Chairman of NSIS Dr. Paul Perera and the Director of NSIS Anushke Perera by the head mistress of upper section and we should compliment her tribute as a masterpiece of her own creation that paid a glowing tribute to the Chairman and Director of the Negombo South International School. It was the first prize-giving of the school which synchronised with the tenth anniversary and do fervently hope and pray that our alma mater will wake up and cross any barrier and march towards our only vision and mission of providing the best of education to the sons and daughters of mother Lanka.</p>", "category": "School", "title": "Negombo South International School Network", "author": "Giyan Chandima"},

NipunPerera along with it\u2019s board of Directors recently concluded some key projects to benefit their community.<br>\nSaving our shores : The first amongst the line up of these worthy projects was \u201cTeam Up to Clean Up \u201c which was launched to clean up the beach of Wellawatte, joined by many of the other Rotaract Clubs in the district. Speaking of the project the president of the club Nipun said \u201c Our beaches are the frontier of the oceans health .Garbage \u2013 especially plastics \u2013 degrade over time and they release chemicals into the environment. Once those chemicals have leached into water and soil, it can take many years for them to break down. In addition when this trash gets washed into the ocean, animals can easily mistake this trash such as plastic bags and bottles for a certain food source. Study after study has shown that a large number of marine animal deaths are now a direct result of marine debris such as this . With the ocean being an important source that provides us with the basic elements of life such as producing half of the oxygen that is in the air we breathe, as well as being an imperative part of the water cycle by supplying us with the water we drink, we strongly believed that all of us have a profound stake in having a healthy ocean that is free of trash and debris and in protecting our marine animals from an untimely death . These were the key aims we had in conducting this project\u201c .<br>\nSaving lives through blood donation :The second project titled \u201cSave a Life \u201c consisted of a blood donation campaign with the aim contributing to assist Thalasemic children as well as other patients who need blood transfusion. On the day, 75 people donated blood for this worthy cause and the collection was donated to the blood bank of Sri Lanka.<br>\nPaying respect to the Departed :The next project initiated by the RotaractClub of EDULINKnamed \u201cDignity for Departed\u201d comprised of cleaning up the neglected GorakanaCemetry in Panadura that was overgrown with grass and not maintained .The students cleared up the grounds and the pathways leading to the graves , placed garden seats in the cemetery and lighted up the whole cemetery with oil lamps and lanterns . To close off the proceedings a pirith ceremony was conducted.<br>\nThe Rotaract Club of EDULINK since it\u2019s inception has been instrumental in holding many worthy projects of this nature over the last two years .In addition, to these community service projects they have also completed a series of events to foster the talents of the youth through \u201c YOLO challenge\u201d a series of fun filled and knowledge building activities for students who have just completed their ordinary level and advanced level examinations to step out of their comfort zone and to put into practice all the theory they have learnt by practically adopting them into real life scenarios that will test their team spirit, time management, leadership skills, physical strength and courage , Wild Card\u201d, an exciting and entertaining card tournament comprising of OMI and 304. Rotaractors from the fellow clubs participated and it acted as a perfect platform for all the rotaractors to bond with each other. And SPARK an event targeted for talented individuals to unleash their voice and compete against each other .<br>\nWith a short history of just two years, the Rotaract club of EDULINK will continue their quest of working together to help assist in lending a hand to solve some of our community\u2019s most challenging problems.</p>", "category": "Uncategorized", "title": "Rotaract club of edulink conducts series of beneficial projects", "author": "Giyan Chandima"},
{"content": "<p>Horizon Campus has become one of only three recognised institutions to offer the world renowned degrees of the University of London in Sri Lanka. Horizon Campus started its operations in the year 2011 and has been working with the prestigious University of London in the following year. The long term plan was is to offer its degrees at its purpose built campus premises in Malabe. Apart from being a UGC/MoHE approved degree awarding body, Horizon also offers an international flavor via degree programmes offered through partnerships with another 5 other different international universities around the world.<br>\nHowever, its \u201cJewel in the Crown\u201d was always working with the University of London International Programmes. The vision and mission of the management of Horizon Campus was to become recognised by the University of London within as short a time as possible. To this end, Horizon has always strived to maintain the required facilities and achieve exam results which would satisfy the minimum standards needed of partners of the University. The initial goal of achieving the \u201cRECOGNITION\u201d from the University of London was achieved by the end of 2014 and the Campus has continued to strive with its goals of excelling in academia over the next 1 \u00bd years.<br>\nHorizon Campus now offers the prospective students of the LL.B. degree programmesyet another pathway through the \u201cCert in Common Law\u201d, which is otherwise previously known as the \u201cDiploma in Law.\u201c Horizon Campus takes pride in the simple fact that it is yet again the fastest in Sri Lanka, to receive this right/privilege from the University of London International Programmes.<br>\nThe CertHE Common Law is a qualification in its own right and provides a pathway into the second year of the LL.B. degree programme. The subjects taught on the CEertHE are as the same taught on the 1st year of the LL.B pathway. Thus the opportunity of entering the 2nd year of the LL.B., once qualified to do so via the CertHE study route.<br>\nThe benefits of the CertHE in Common Law are many. Key amongst them is the fact that a student could study for the CertHE, with sufficient O/L qualifications, provided he/she satisfies the age requirements. Furthermore, this is also a qualification in itself, meaning that if a student wishes to exit the UoL Laws programme, he or she would have a world recognized qualification after 1 year of study. Furthermore, unlike the degree pathway route, the students could continue classes for the CertHE on a fulltime basis and revert to the part time programme from the 2nd year of their study programme.<br>\nIn order to receive recognition for the CertHE in Common Law programme, an institution has to demonstrate that it meets or exceeds a set of Recognition Criteria developed by the University of London, set out as expectations and indicators. To this end, the University of London undertook a stringent review of Horizon Campus, culminating in the visit of a panel of senior staff from the University of London and those Colleges that provide academic direction for the degrees offered at Horizon. This panel met with students, lecturers and staff alike, to identify and ascertain whether Horizon Campus had maintained achieved the required standards to obtain such a recognition from the University.<br>\nThe facilities requirement was supplemented by the students reading for their degree programmes also achieving excellent results at the exams held last May, which was over 93% for the LLB and 90% for the BSc Degrees, respectively. The \u201cCommendation\u201d received by Horizon Campus from the University of London is proof in itself of the academic excellence achieved by its students, over the past several years. Furthermore, Horizon Campus has also strived to provide students with the necessary international and industry exposure by organizing foreign transfer programmes, scholarship schemes which has assisted in relieving the financial burden to parents, transport facilities to and from Campus, organization of CSR Projects and extra- curricular activities through its Student Council, which delivers on the truly holistic atmosphere required for higher education.<br>\nHorizon Campus currently offers tuition/support to 4 university of London &amp; London School of Economics Degrees through the International Programmes as follows:<br>\nLL.B.<br>\nBsc in Accounting &amp; Finance<br>\nBsc in Banking &amp; finance<br>\nBsc in Business &amp; management</p>", "category": "Uncategorized", "title": "Register now at Horizon Campus for Cert.HE in Law/LL.B", "author": "Ajith Indrajeewa"},

Henry Steele Olcott clamoured and awakened a nation that was fast a sleep without any vigour to rise up. He was the pioneer who agitated to give due place to Buddhism and the reformer who compelled the colonial government that existed at that time to declare the Vesak Full Moon Day, a public holiday. He was the architect who designed the six coloured Buddhist Flag that has gained universal recognition. He was one of the pioneers responsible for the establishment of National Schools such as Ananda College.<br>\nearing the 130th Anniversary celebrations of establishment of Ananda College, Colombo, it is our duty to remember our founders including Col.

The audience will comprise of Old Boys of Ananda College, Principal and academic staff, distinguished invitees including eminent academics, scholars and professionals in various fields. Several embassies are also invited to grace the occasion as well. Col. Olcott whose contribution towards the betterment of our country, nation, religion, justice and good conduct has been so great, therefore remains in our hearts forever.<br>\nHis motto was \u201cThe best religion is nothing but the Truth\u201d. He established the Theosophical Society at New York in America on the 17th November 1875, towards the achievements of his goal.<br>\nAs a result of his endeavor towards justice, good conduct, universal fraternity and freedom many erudites around the world gathered around him. We have to record our highest gratitude to Madam Helena Blavatsky who assisted him in all his endeavours. Col. Olcott was an American. However when we look into his clan, we note that his parents were English and had migrated to America. He was the eldest of a family of six siblings. This great child was born on August 2, 1832.<br>\nAs an enthusiastic scholar, his research in agriculture in particular paved way for him to become the Head of a Department at Athens University of Greece. However he declined to accept this honour and instead he established an educational institution in agriculture because he preferred to serve his mother country. During the American Civil War, he joined the army and through his achievements was appointed colonel. American government appreciated his bravery and sharp wisdom, appointed him Commissioner to investigate and report on corruption in the American army. He performed this task very well.<br>\nFor some time he practised as a lawyer. Although he was a Christian by birth, he came across a copy of the Panadura Controversy by Ven. Migettuwaththe Gunananda Thera, in Ceylon.<br>\nHe who was in search of the Truth and found it in Buddhist philosophy highlighted in this famous controversy. Col. Olcott made an extensive study of Buddhism. Consequently with a team of people, including Madam Blavatsy came to Ceylon (then) on May 17, 1880 and at Vijayananda, Pirivena at Weliwatta, Galle. Col. Olcott and Madam Blavatsky became true Buddhists by accepting the Triple Gem and observing Panchaseela, from Ven. Akmeemana Dharmarama, Chief Monk.<br>\nThrough his close association with intellectuals such as Ven. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala, Chief Monk, Ven. Miggettuwatte Gunananda Thera and Ven. Waskaduwe Sri Subuthi Thera, Col. Olcott realised the sad plight of the Sinhala Buddhists at that time. Considering the gravity of this, he thought of the need to unite and create a formidable workforce to act fast.<br>\nHe realised the need to provide Buddhist children with an appropriate Buddhist environment through a systematic Buddhist education and to achieve this objective, he established the Colombo Buddhist Theosophical Society on June 17, 1880. He thought that the future prosperity of the nation, will depend on the good conduct and education of the living children, and therefore purchased a building at Maliban Street, where the Colombo Buddhist Theosophical Society office was established and subsequently used the same building where an English school was established with 37 children. W. Lead Beater was appointed Principal.<br>\nMr. Leadbeater, an Englishman, provided education free of charge till 1889. After 1889 A. E. Bultjourns was appointed principal and when the number of children increased and the school was shifted to Maradana, present day Ananda College which became one of the foremost colleges in Sri Lanka, found its beginnings at a small hall in Pettah. This was through the foresight and wisdom of Col. Olcott. Colombo Buddhist Theosophical Society was able to establish many Buddhist schools.<br>\nWith a sense of pride we have to point out to the country that as a result of pursuing the thinking of Col. Olcott, Colombo Buddhist Theosophical Society was able to establish 460 Buddhist schools, including leading colleges such as Ananda, Nalanda, Dharmapala, Dharmaraja, Visakha and Musaeus College.<br>\nAmid various adversities, difficulties, obstacles, great men like Col. Olcott who directed our nation in the proper direction towards advancement at a stage when Sinhala Buddhists had forgotten their good culture and traditions, it is our duty to commemorate them with a sense of deep gratitude. Younger generation in particular must be knowledgable about the excellent qualities of this great leader, about his life and history and follow his path leading to advancement of our country.<br>\nWhen we remember the fact that great schools of learning such as Ananda, Nalanda and Dharmaraja produced national leaders and others who did a lot for their country and also when we remember that colleges for ladies like Musaeus and Viskha produced heroic mothers for the country, we can imagine that they get the blessings and grace of Col. Olcott who may be at a higher place in the universe.<br>\nOur nation was gifted with heroins and heroes, such as Viharamaha Devi, Dutugemunu, Parkramabahu the Great. We can remember the manner in which even a great person like Anagarika Dharmapala was brought to the forefront with the able guidance of this rare type of great men like Col. Olcott and in that we observe that differences such as religion, race, or caste or black or white are not at all barriers, when such great men go in search of the Truth.<br>\nCol. Olcott made every endeavour to awaken the Buddhist and to impress English rulers to prove that Sinhalese are a great race. Although he belonged to a different faith, he embraced Buddhism and the immense contribution made by him for Buddhism and Sinhala people. Every Sinhalese in the past, present and future is indebted to him. Finally at a time he was able to see that his efforts have become fruitful, he became very happy and expressed his sentiments before Rev. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Chief Monk, whom Col. Olcott considered as teacher.<br>\n\u201cSeeds have been sown. These have grown and become large trees. My dear Rev. Sir, No force on this earth or above can stop its growth and fruition in the future.\u201d</p>", "category": "Events", "title": "at Kularatne Hall, Ananda College : Olcott Oration 2016 today", "author": "Giyan Chandima"},

The students graduating today are those who have made the smart decision to undertake a Pearson\u2019s BTEC Level 5 qualification. This is a smart decision as many students look to pursue further academic study either immediately or sometime in the future and this qualification allows students such flexibility. The Pearson\u2019s BTEC HND Level 5 qualification is equivalent to the 2nd Year of a UK Honours degree. By undertaking this program students have access to more than 300 Universities that recognise Pearson\u2019s BTEC HND programmes in countries such as the UK, USA, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. This is important as it provides students with global mobility, which is important in today\u2019s context.<br>\nThe need for continued support is something that CSCT Management and staff values.

Therefore, CSCT provides support to students who do not want to pursue further education by facilitating placements and even future employment. In fact, many employers seek CSCT student\u2019s out for employment even before they graduate which is testament to the quality of a CSCT BTEC HND Graduate.<br>\nCSCT also provides options for those students who do not wish to travel overseas for further studies through its partnership with the University of Salford.<br>\nIn fact, most of our graduates today will join one of the degree programmes offered at CSCT such as the BSc (Hons) In Quantity Surveying conducted in partnership with the University of Salford or the BSc (Hons) in Construction Management offered in affiliation with Birmingham City University.<br>\nGraduation day is an exciting time not only for students but also for us here at CSCT, as it allows us to see the fruits of our labour.

{"content": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">By Prof. Neluka Fernando Hony. Vice Chancellor, KIU<br>\nBiomedical science is an exciting field with spectacular career opportunities for those seeking employment today. To most the actual scope and who a biomedical scientist is still an enigma in Sri Lanka. A brief introduction, the field of study and the job scope with special reference to foreignemployment opportunities with a degree in biomedical science are discussed.<br>\nA biomedical scientist who could also be referred to as a \u201cmedical scientist\u201d or \u201cclinical laboratory scientist\u201d is trained in biology, particularly in the context of medicine.These scientists work to gain knowledge on the main principles of how the human body works and to discover new ways to diagnose,cure or treat disease by developing advanced diagnostic tools or new therapeutic strategies. It further involves a sound knowledge on research, the cutting edge of knowledge empowerment. The research of a biomedical scientists is referred to as biomedical research. In recent decades research opportunities are made available from basic science through clinical research to health services research, through advances in the biomedical field.<br>\nThe fields of study for a biomedical scientist has a greater scope and covers areas such as biochemistry, molecular biology, epidemiology, haematology, transfusion medicine, histopathology, immunology, microbiology , parasitology, pharmacology, anatomy physiology and laboratory management.Fields such as basic and advanced pharmacology, clinical/systemic microbiology and pathology, applied hematology and biostatisticsare the newer fields thathave been addedto the biomedical science degree, thus giving it a wider scope.<br>\nFurthermore, the approach for biomedical science teaching emphasizes and focuses on a particular system of the body or disease process as a whole, drawing upon multiple specialties in teaching rather than concentrating on isolated subjects. In other words it\u2019s a clinical based multi- disciplinary approach. Given this new method of teaching, currently,especially in developed countries the graduated biomedicalscientist remain interdisciplinary and do not specialize in just one subject, although there is opportunity to specialize inthe given fields.<br>\nBiomedical scientists typically are degree holders and usually take postgraduate studies to further enhance their career path. This degree enables one to seek faculty positions at academic institutions, as well as senior scientist positions in industry.The category with tenured faculty positions at universities, colleges, non-profit research institutes, and sometimes hospitals, usually afford more intellectual freedom and have time for research. In addition they are able to attend scientific conferences, compete for research grant funding, publish scientific papers, and take up teaching for undergraduates.<br>\nFurther the skills gained on a biomedical science degree helps one to embark on a range of scientific careers, discovering vital medical developments and improving the lives of others. The direct career opportunities available include biomedical scientist, healthcare scientist( clinical biochemistry), healthcare scientist (genetics), healthcare scientist (haematology), healthcare scientist(immunology) and microbiologist.<br>\nYet another attractive opportunity for those pursing the biomedical science degree is the opening for the industry at for-profit corporations. Employment is usually at large pharmaceutical companies or biotechnology companies. These positions in industry tend to pay higher salaries than those at academic institutions. However, the research oriented bio scientist in industry would have less intellectual freedom to engage in research than those in the academic sector, owing to the ultimate goal of producing marketable products that benefit the company.<br>\nIn recent years, more biomedical scientists have pursued careers where advanced education and experience in biomedical research is needed outside of traditional laboratory research. These areas include patent law, consulting and science journalism.<br>\nWhen seeking a course to study biomedical science, employability/recognition of the degree is of vital importance. The course content, the quality of teaching, the learning environment, research activities and the facilities available are key factors looked in to byemployers. For a degree to be recognized it must integrate a basic knowledge of human biology, cellular and molecular biology and analytical techniques with the specialist subjects. High quality courses integrate aspects of clinical and routine laboratory diagnosis with a holistic view of biomedical sciences. These broader courses prepare one for a wider range of careers, including university research, government- funded research laboratories, and a whole range of careers in the global pharmaceutical and biosciences industries.<br>\nAccording to the national human resources and employment policy of Sri Lanka, the increasing demand for supply of workers in the mid professional, skilled and semi-skilled job categories have not been met in foreign employment for Sri Lanka. In 2009 there was a demand for 784,212 jobs however only 247,119 was supplied. Biomedical scientists are listed as a skilled occupation in many of the developed countries\u2019 skilled occupation list category (SOL) for migration. Thus a biomedical scientist is at an advantage when seeking employment not only in the local job market but in the foreign market as well.<br>\nAt KIU which is a Ministry of Higher Education accredited, University Grants Commission recognized degree awarding institute: the first batch of Bachelor of Science Honours in Biomedical Science has commenced. KIU is proud to be able to award a completely Sri Lankan degree in Bachelor of Science Honours in Biomedical Science approved by the MoHErecognized by the UGC. We at KIU offer a highly qualified teaching panel with a state of the art laboratory for training these graduates. The first batch of undergraduates enrolled in Bachelor of Science Honours in Biomedical Scienceare on the way to achieving their life goals.<br>\nIn conclusion today, globally science and technology are advancing rapidly,providing opportunities to improve the quality of care for people at all stages of their lives. Care delivery is also changing, with new models of integrated care emerging for different care settings. Roles for the healthcare science workforce has changed as a result. Thus the urgent need to modernize scientific careers to provide competent and highly equipped staff with the right set of knowledge and skills for today and for tomorrow.<br>\nThe writer is holder of MBBS, Dip Micro (UOC) PhD (LONDON, UK)<br>\nWebsite: www.kiu.lk</p>", "category": "Higher Education", "title": "Biomedical scientist : A forefront  career  opportunity at KIU", "author": "Giyan Chandima"},

How self-disciplined were you before you started med school? How about now? You should ask this from a Medical Doctor. You\u2019re also likely to be a good decision maker simply because you must do it constantly in situations where the stakes can be high. Students in our Universities have transformed them to be better people than they used to be and independent in their work.<br>\n8. You relieve more than just physical pain. Particularly in primary care, you address your patients\u2019 vulnerability to not just disease, but also to loneliness, fear, and anxiety and even many more. True, a disturbing number are noncompliant with the help and advice you offer, but never doubt the effect you\u2019ve had on people who survive and thrive simply because you bothered to listen.<br>\n7. Your opinions count now. Just by virtue of your profession, you earn respect in your community &amp; else where\u2014 not as much, perhaps, as previous generations but more than you might think. You can use this power to effect real change in your community, and not just on healthcare issues. You\u2019re smart and accomplished. People will listen to you, so pipe up.<br>\n6. Don\u2019t worry much..you won\u2019t be jobless Yes, the recession has hit every sector, including healthcare. But even employed docs who lose a job don\u2019t stay out of work for long, unless they choose to. There are way more people who need doctors than there are doctors. Also have you ever heard of a Doctor who doesn\u2019t have a job?<br>\n5. You\u2019re free to move about the country, as a certain airline says. The physician shortage means you can decide to work virtually anywhere you want.<br>\n4. You can be your own Doctor!

{"content": "<p>The University of London (UoL) LL.B offered by the CfPS Law School, is considered to be one of the most versatile and sought after degrees in Sri Lanka. Though there are many routes to enter into the legal profession, many prospective lawyers opt for the UoL LL.B provided by the CFPS Law School. This is not only because the degree is reputed and flexible but also because it is a multifaceted degree, where students will be able to complement other professional and academic qualifications with their LLB(London).<br>\nMr. Nanda Muruttettuwegama, joint Managing Director of the CFPS Law School, further elaborated about the UoL law courses.<br>\n1. How does one enter into the legal profession in Sri Lanka through the UoL LLB degree?<br>\nIn a period of 3 years, prospective law students should complete their LL.B degree. If the student is already a degree holderfrom any recognized university by the UoL (can be of any discipline), it would take the student a minimum of 2 years to complete the LL.B degree. After obtaining the degree, the student can gain entry to Law College to obtain his/her professional qualification. This route is considered to be more fruitful as the student will be able to procure a LL.B degree and can gainentrance directly to the Sri Lanka Law College, without facing the extremely competitive Law college entrance examination. An LL.B (Lon.) degree holder will only take a year to complete the Law College examinations, rather than the stipulated three years. Following the completion of the student\u2019s professional qualification obtained through Law College, the student will be able to take oaths as an Attorney-at-Law.<br>\n2. What are the benefits of choosing the University of London LL.B rather than any other LLB from the UK?<br>\nThe University of London was established in 1858, and has stood through the ages as one of the top rated and prestigious universities in the world and in the UK. The standard of the UoL LL.B is assured by the Quality Assurance Agency of the UK. The UoL LL.B is regarded as an \u2018international gold standard\u2019 in legal education. It is a proven fact that UoL law graduates are of high caliber and a have a greater edge over many other UK law graduates in regards to career opportunities within the legal profession both in Sri Lanka and aboard.<br>\n3. Can a student do the University of London LL.B without going to England?<br>\nYes, it is indeed possible to do the entire course by following lectures atCfPS law School. The British Council conducts the examinations on behalf of the UoL. The papers are, thereafter sent to London to be marked by UoL examiners. The same examiners mark the examinations of the students of the Colleges of the UoL as well. It is important to note that the LLB degree is awarded by the UoL and not by the CFPS Law School.<br>\n4. What are the benefits of following the UOL LLB at the CFPS law school?<br>\nThe CFPS Law School is a unique institution as its prime focus is on Law. The CFPS is a registered centre of the UoL International programmes. The CFPS Law School was established in 1991 and has produced over 5,000 lawyers during this period. These successful lawyers have not only been produced through our UoL L.L.B course but also through our Law College entrance courses.<br>\n5. What are special features of the course?<br>\nWe have an academic faculty that includes both legal practitioners and legal academics who possess both local and UK academic and professional qualifications. We have interactive lecture sessions which ensure that our students receive individual attention thereby helping them to discover and improve their true potential. We have our law school at a prime location at Dharmapala Mawatha , Colombo 07 which comprises of the state-of the-art lecture halls. We also provide free wi-fi facilities and library access throughout the week. Career guidance is an integral part of the foundation of the CfPS Law School, with students receiving numerous opportunities in furthering their carriers through our special internship programmes.<br>\nTo give our students the opportunity to explore their abilities, and fine tune their skills we frequently organize moot court sessions, informative court visits, educative parliamentary visits, student union debates and many other such activities. We believe extra-curricular activities are vital for a student\u2019s overall holistic education.<br>\n6.

The \u201cCommendation\u201d received by Horizon Campus from the University of London is proof in itself of the academic excellence achieved by its students, over the past several years.

There is a multitude of benefits in Green constructions. Amongst the key inherent advantages of Green buildings are established to a longer life cycle, environmental friendly, conserve energy and directly benefits to human health, while improving productivity of the occupants. It is because of the wide ranging plus factors that the Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB) works vigorously towards the expansion of Green constructions in Sri Lanka. The CIOB has initiated a series of programs to achieve the objective of more Green buildings. One of the key tasks in this process involves the inspection of large-scale Green constructions in terms of compliance with accepted international standards and norms and awarding quality certification to those within the range of these global specifications. They are presented with the locally and internationally accepted CIOB Green Mark certificate. We obtain the technical support of the Singapore Government\u2019s Building and Construction Authority, for this purpose. The Ceylon Institute of Builders has already awarded the Green Mark certification to many leading Green buildings in the country. In the NSBM Green University inaugurated recently, all aspects of construction have been done completely in adherence to Green specifications. We awarded the CIOB Green Mark certificate to this building complex after an inspection in terms of global benchmark quality standards. The NSBM University in Sri Lanka is the first-ever Green University in the whole of South Asia. This institution is owned by the Sri Lankan Government. As the premier body which awards Green Mark certification, we are happy that the NSBM University is a Green building complex and that CIOB as a leading Green Building accreditor in Sri Lanka, was able to recognize and honor this University Town\u201d.<br>\nThe Ceylon Institute of Builders initiate two prestigious award ceremonies annually with the core objective of giving a motivation to promote Green building concept in Sri Lanka and also to drive them to achieve international benchmark quality standards. Qualifying Green Products and Green Institutions are awarded CIOB Green Mark certificates at these bi-annual events. In addition, the CIOB also conducts advanced training courses on achieving global standards through Green construction management for professionals of leading construction companies. The Ceylon Institute of Builders is, therefore, not only the leading, but also the pioneer organization in awarding Green constructions in keeping with international benchmark standards. In collaboration with the Building Economics and Management Research Unit (BEMRU), Department of Building Economics, University of Moratuwa, the Ceylon Institute of Builders has been organizing the World Construction Symposium in Sri Lanka for the past five years.

{"content": "<p>The future looks exciting. At the recently concluded Google developer conference called \u201cGoogle I/O 2017\u201d, Sunder Pichai, the CEO of Google showed off a wonderful piece of new technology called the \u201cGoogle Lens\u201d. It is an AI powered application, which runs on a smartphone and can make sense of what is around it.<br>\nIn the demo, Sundar points his phone camera at a restaurant on the street and voila, the Google AI genie reads the name board, figures out where the restaurant is based on where the phone is (well, now you know why Google had been spending millions on Google Maps and Google StreetView) and tells you what the menus are, shows you the reviews and let you reserve a table if the restaurant has an online reservation system.<br>\nIn my opinion, what Google Chief showed off that day is not just super cool technology, but also the future of marketing. If you are a marketer, this is how customers are going to find you in the future.<br>\nThey will not find you through your polished print ads or your annoying YouTube video ads. They will find you on the street through Google Lens, they will find your name mentioned on a Twitter feed or on a Facebook post and decide to check you out. Most advertising in the world is becoming digital too.<br>\nMillions of consumers get their first brand experience through a digital medium and in the UK alone, companies spent \u00a310.3 billion on digital advertising in 2016 (IAB/PwC Digital AdSpend Report).<br>\nSo where does Horizon Campus fit in this digital scheme of things? Marketing is a highly lucrative occupation and there is tremendous interest among young people to study marketing.<br>\nThe choices are enormous. How would a young, aspiring marketer choose what to study and where to study? How do you choose the right marketing degree for you?<br>\nEven Though the choices seem bewildering, the way to choose, in fact is not that hard. The simple advice to the aspiring marketing student is; \u201cdo not be misled or blinded by the digital hype!\u201d Yes, marketing is going digital, so is everything else for that matter.<br>\nJust because marketing is going digital, it does not mean the basic marketing concepts or business concepts are going to change. You must choose a degree that teach you the basics, the theories and teach you how to apply them to the real world.<br>\nThat is where Horizon Campus Management Degrees outshine the rest.<br>\nHorizon Campus Management Degrees are designed to be future proof. We make sure that our graduates are ready for the next wave by making sure that they develop a broad set of skills and a wide knowledge base. Above anything else, marketers are business executives.<br>\nThey, like any other business executive, are given budgets and people as resources, targets to meet using those resources, they have unpredictable competitors to deal with, finicky customers to satisfy and they have a limited time to make things happen.<br>\nA marketer who understands only marketing (or worse only digital marketing) cannot thrive in this complex corporate world.<br>\nWhy? Because your competitors are always scheming to derail your clever marketing plans and your customer needs keep changing. The basic assumption in economics, ceteris paribus, does not apply to marketing.<br>\nEverything changes constantly and marketing professionals must work with all other disciplines in the organisation to make their plans work. Marketing must work with finance specialists and for that marketers must understand finance, work hand in glove with operations experts and this needs a good knowledge of operations, they have to work with HR, with production and in the digital marketing world, work as a close knit team with the IT professionals of the firm.<br>\nThey must understand and appreciate the challenges of digitization, globalization and regional integration and how these macro trends affect customer choice.<br>\nIn short, a good marketer needs to know a lot more than marketing and that is what Horizon Campus is geared to offer.<br>\nHorizon Campus Honours Degree in Marketing is a four year full-time honoursprogramme and is a fully fledged business degree. Students learn all essential business management subjects areas including economics, management accounting, finance, IT, operations management, global business, statistics, research methods and human resources management during the first three years.<br>\nAt the end of the third year, students are sent on a compulsory industrial training for six months to work as full time employees and then return to campus to complete their specialization in Marketing Management.<br>\nOur interns would be assigned to Marketing Departments of carefully selected corporations and would be tasked with assisting the Marketing Managers of these organisations.<br>\nDuring their six month industrial training/internship, regular assessments are conducted which allows the Horizon Campus academic leadership to monitor the student progress, the learning and training they have received as well as to iron out issues as they arise.<br>\nThe assessments conducted during the internship period includes two face to face meetings where the intern meets with the Dean of the faculty and the Vice Chancellor to discuss progress. Further assessments are conducted by their corporate supervisors who submit reports on the progress of the interns working under their guidance.<br>\nAt the end of the six month internship, the undergraduates will return to campus and start their honours year specializing in Marketing Management.<br>\nThe areas covered in marketing specialization includes, advanced marketing management, branding and brand activation, marketing research, global marketing, consumer behaviour and marketing communications with digital marketing.<br>\nWith this unique programme structure, marketing undergraduates of Horizon Campus receives real world exposure, working under practicing managers their compatriots in other programmes would not receive.</p>", "category": "Higher Education", "title": "Horizon Campus shows the path to your future marketing career", "author": "Ajith Indrajeewa"},

To those seeking a career in the field of human biology or seeking a laboratory based career with interest in research obtaining a degree in Biomedical Science would be a monumental gain in achieving life goals.<br>\nIn a nutshell Biomedical Science is the study of the structure and function of the human body in health and disease. A Biomedical undergraduate would essentially require an understanding of anatomy, physiology, medical biochemistry, medicalmicrobiology, pharmacology, molecular biology, clinicalmicrobiology andimmunology to name a few.<br>\nFields such as basic and advanced pharmacology, clinical/systemic microbiology and pathology, applied hematology and biostatistics are the newer fields that have been added to the biomedical science degree when compared to the medical laboratory science degree, thus giving it a wider scope.<br>\nDuring this study programme a student acquires the ability to understand, critically analyze and interpret scientific and biomedical data. Further the student gets an opportunity toengage in biomedical research and be able to read scientific publications which helps in exposure to the latest research developments. Another great advantage is the opportunity to acquireprofessional writing skills to convey scientific information in a meaningful way.<br>\nBiomedical scientists typically are degree holders and usually take postgraduate studies to further enhance their career path. This degree enables one to seek faculty positions at academic institutions, as well as senior scientist positions in industry.The category with tenured faculty positions at universities, colleges, non-profit research institutes, and sometimes hospitals, usually afford more intellectual freedom and have time for research. In addition they are able to attend scientific conferences, compete for research grant funding, publish scientific papersand take up teaching of undergraduates.<br>\nFurther the skills gained during a Biomedical Science degree helps oneto embark on a range of scientific careers, discovering vital medical developments and improving the lives of others. The direct career opportunities available include Biomedical scientist and healthcare scientist in industry, research institutions and health care settings in various fields including biochemistry, genetics, haematology and microbiology.<br>\nYet another attractive opportunity for those pursing the Biomedical Science degree is the opening of the \u201cfor-profit\u201dindustry corporations. Employment at large pharmaceutical companies or biotechnology companies can be obtained with a degree in Biomedical Science. These positions in industry tend to pay higher salaries than those at academic institutions.<br>\nWhen seeking a course to study Biomedical Science, employability/recognition of the degree is of vital importance. Most often to work as a clinical biomedical scientist approval of relevant regulatory bodies of thatparticular country is important. The course content, the quality of teaching, the learning environment, research activities and the facilities available are key factors looked in to by regulatory bodies. For a degree to be recognized it must integrate a basic knowledge of human biology, cellular and molecular biology and analytical techniques with the specialist subjects. High quality courses integrate aspects of clinical and routine laboratory diagnosis with a holistic view of biomedical sciences. These broader courses prepare one for a wider range of careers, including university research, government- funded research laboratories, and a whole range of careers in the global pharmaceutical and biosciences industries.<br>\nKIU is a Ministry of higher education accredited, University grant commission recognized degree awarding institute. BSc. Honours in Biomedical science has commenced and is now taking in the 3rdBatch of students. KIU youis proud to be able to award a completely Sri Lankan degree in Bsc (Hons) in Biomedical science approved by the Ministryof Higher Education recognizedby the UGC. We at KIU offer a highly qualified teachingpanel with a state of the art laboratory for trainingof these graduates.<br>\nIn conclusion today, globally science and technology are advancing rapidly,providing opportunities to improve the quality of care for people at all stages of their lives. Care delivery is also changing, with new models of integrated care emerging for different care settings. Roles forthe healthcare science workforce has changed as a result. Thus the urgent need to modernize scientific careers to provide competent and highlyequipped staff with the right set of knowledge and skills for today and for tomorrow.</p>", "category": "Higher Education", "title": "offers better opportunities  in Biomedical Science", "author": "Ajith Indrajeewa"},

After completing her AS level, Keshani joined ANC where she received a scholarship of 25% of the tuition fee for her immense talents and academic strength. At ANC, she won the High Achiever\u2019s Award in 2013 and in 2016. Considering her exceptional achievements, she was given the Limelight Recognition at ANC\u2019s convocation in 2016. She has now been accepted to William Paterson University of New Jersey, USA to read for her Doctor of Psychology (PsyD) degree.<br>\nFrom a very young age, Keshani showcased immense talent in athletics. During her school days at Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya, she took part in Asian Youth Games held in 2009 in Singapore \u2013 which allowed her to claim the Most Promising Athlete of the Year Award at the School Colors Night. Owing to her achievements as a young athlete, she was given a full scholarship by Gateway College, where she continued her studies and athletic career. At Gateway, she received the Dove Award which is the highest level of honors given to students who represent the country and the school at the national level. After completing her studies at Gateway, she joined the Athletic Squad of the Sri Lankan Army, representing the country at various international events.On account of her athletic records, Keshani received national colors from 2008 for five years, consecutively.<br>\nBelow are the excerpts from the interview with Keshani:<br>\nHow did you gain entry into PsyD in Clinical Psychology?<br>\nMy BSc in psychology as well as social work and internships I did while I was at ANC were very useful. For doctoral studies, they screen 400 to 500 applications. Last year, I got selected to an MSc program at Colombia University which is an Ivy League university. However, I did not receive enough funding for that. ButWillian Patterson University offered me direct entry to the doctorate \u2013 andoffered Graduate Assistantship at the university. Apart from my grades, they also considered my work experience in the field. During my studies, I volunteered at the Son Rise Program where I had the privilege to care for an autistic child. I also worked at Emerge Lanka as an intern, dealing with issues related tovictims of sexual abuse. While doing my internships and volunteering, I continued to work as a Special Needs Teacher at ABC School of Early Learning. All of it added to strengthen my application.<br>\nWhat made you choose a<br>\nPsychology degree at ANC?<br>\nI was introduced to psychology at Gateway during my AS level \u2013 which I found very interesting. It is exciting to learn about human behaviors and how the mind works. Since I had a clear view of what I wanted to be doing, instead of continuing my A/Levels, I joined ANC which offered a psychology degree from a top US university.<br>\nWhy didn\u2019t you go to the US for your undergraduate studies?<br>\nThe ANC US Psychology degree was lesser than half the price of going abroad for studies. At that time, I was not mature enough. My parents were also hesitant to send me abroad at a young age like that. Besides, I didn\u2019t see a point in going abroad when I could have the same degree in Sri Lanka. I understand that studying in the US may give you more exposure and experience. But it made more sense for me to enroll at ANC \u2013 and later, go abroad for my postgraduate studies.<br>\nHow do you describe the standards of ANC\u2019s Psychology faculty?<br>\nANC\u2019s faculty is exceptional. We had local as well as foreign lecturers. They were all well experienced, knowledgeable and highly qualified. It was a rewarding experience to work with a panel of lecturers who could give us proper guidance and supervision. They taught us with such passion, reminding us as to how we could give back to society.<br>\nWhat standsout in ANC\u2019s<br>\npsychology curriculum?<br>\nThe curriculum was very relevant and challenging. It included a minimum three-month compulsory internship \u2013 based on which we were graded. Throughout the degree, we were supervised and were introduced to places where we could find internships. This gave us opportunity to explore areas of our interest. The curriculum included a lot of research and hands-on experience.<br>\nWhat is your overall experience<br>\nat ANC?<br>\nIt was great. Apart from studies, I had time to take the role as the Sports Captain at ANC in 2013/14 and as the President of the Performing Arts Club in 2015/16. ANC created an arena for students to showcase their talents and interact with peers as well as the professional community.<br>\nWhat are the opportunities in the field of Psychology in Sri Lanka?<br>\nWe have a big void of qualified psychology professionals. There\u2019s an increasing demand for those who are qualified in psychology to fill that void. For my doctorate, I study clinical psychology with a focus on children and adolescents. There\u2019s a huge lack of professionals in pediatric psychology. My plan is to be qualified and come back to Sri Lanka to start a center dedicated to deal with such issues related to mental health. There are many opportunities out there.<br>\n<strong>For more information on ANC Education degree programs, please contact:</strong><br>\n<strong>0777449955|www.ancedu.com| No.308 \u2013 310, R. A.

{"content": "<p>Ms. Chanuki Wanniarachchi<br>\nBSc in Psychology, Lecturer, KIU<br>\nPsychology, the field which unravels the mysteries of the human brain, definitely has an interesting history behind it. On the verge of exploring the human brain and curing mental illnesses, trephining or drilling the skull can be considered as one of the highlights of the history of Psychology. During ancient times, such surgeries were performed if a person behaved \u2018abnormally\u2019. Ever since, it has been evolving, and has become the modern psychology we know of today. Up to date, it has evolved and advanced to a level where, after extensive research done all throughout the decades, more effective and humane psychotherapy came into being.Further, the modern psychology not only focuses on mental illnesses, but rather a broader area. As a result, psychology has been expanded into many different subfields such as Clinical Psychology, Counseling Psychology, Cognitive Psychology, Developmental Psychology, Educational Psychology, Organizational Psychology, Critical Psychology, Health Psychology, Child Psychology, Sports Psychology, Forensic Psychology and many more.<br>\nAs the definition of Psychology: the scientific study of mental processes and behavior, it does implythat psychology deals with the brain and its processes. We, humans have the most complicated and the smartest brain of all species and the brain is a crucial part of the body which influences the existence of mankind. At this point, if you are thinking about the instances where we DON\u2019T use our brain and rather behave unconsciously, I would liketolet you know delightfully, that too is a matter of \u201cpsychology\u201d.<br>\nPsychology has been and continues to be an extremely popular field among many western countries, but is new to Sri Lanka. Earlier, seeking psychological support is considered to be a taboo. Ironically, Psychology was used to be stereotyped as a field which deals with \u201ccrazy people\u201d. Hence, Psychology was not considered as a valuable higher education option and pursuing a career in psychology was considered to be a dead end. However, the truth as well as what\u2019s unique and special about psychology is that it is not a field which is purely based on hospital settings, but a field whichgoes beyond that: businesses, schools, community, crime and law, research and many more. Simply, psychology can be related to any setting or scenario which involves \u2018humans\u2019.<br>\nWith time and much awareness, it\u2019s fascinating to see that now people haveactually started becoming keen to learn more about this \u201cmysterious\u201d subject and seek its help. As an emerging field, psychology has created many career opportunities such as clinical psychologist,school psychologist, forensic psychologist, business psychologist, counselor, researcher, psychotherapist,human resources officer and many more.Within a short span of time, Psychology has given birth to many Sri Lankan Psychologists who are providing an incredible service not only to Sri Lankans but also to the international communities.<br>\nAs the newest addition to the higher education sector, KIU believes in catering more diverse and unique educational opportunities for the Sri Lankan youth. Therefore, KIU is now offering the BSc (Hons) in Psychology degree program which is recognized by the UGC and approved by the Ministry of Higher Education. The curriculum includes the highest number of modules covering many subfields of psychology which are new to Sri Lanka. Further, it includes a research component as well as a placement/internship in order to enable the students to obtain core skills and keep up with the pace of the changing and developing world making them the best in their respective career fields. The vision of KIU is to provide quality education through world class standards. KIU challenges the traditional university teaching styles and introduces futuristic teaching methods which are entirely student-focused and paves way to create leaders rather than mere undergraduates.

{"content": "<p>Business dynamics have changed tremendously. Businesses are increasing operating globally due to open door policies in foreign investment that bring in more employment and career opportunities. Due to a high rate of economic growth more opportunities await the younger generation to obtain employment and have a shot at the international market. Multinationals mainly, seek for graduates with a sound academic knowledge and on-hand experience in International Business to make them part of their global operations.<br>\nAt Universal College Lanka (UCL), we seek to provide for this opportunity by bringing to you an International Business degree from the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) which enables graduates to become highly employable in the global business setting. The University of Central Lancashire (UCLan), UK entered an exclusive partnership with Universal College Lanka (UCL), Sri Lanka to provide a completion degree programme to students in the region. UCLan rests comfortably within the UK\u2019s top 10 modern universities. Currently securing a ranking of 67th (The Guardian University Guide 2018) as one of the most improved universities, it leaped 20 places up to its current position. An International Business Degree from UCLan enables students to gain exposure and be globally qualified right here in Sri Lanka.<br>\nA Degree in International Business Vs Business Management; What is the difference?<br>\nWhile a Business Management degree will teach to manage, plan, direct, control and organize a business/company, in International Business you will learn how to internationalize, manage, carefully study companies and markets, analyze if a product/service/company can enter a market and profit. Under Business Management you will have the tools to manage a team and make it successful on a national scale but a degree in International Business, you will be exposed to the economic, social and cultural influences of countries on business activity.<br>\nDoes the completion option mean that this is an external degree?<br>\nBA (Hons) International Business is a fully internal degree where at the point of enrollment, UCLan students in Sri Lanka will receive a UCLan ID and comprehensive access to all UCLan resources (online) just as how an on-campus student at UCLan (UK) would. The only difference being the country of study. Our lecturers for all modules must coordinate with the respective coordinator lecturer in UCLan (UK) prior to conducting lectures and setting examinations, thereby ensuring the teaching and assessment is up to par with the syllabus and standards of UCLan (UK).<br>\nWhy would employers choose a UCLan graduate overthe rest?<br>\nWith over 125 International institutions, UCLan has a strong research body which is committed to ensuring that syllabuses are formulated and frequently updated to reflect the current global industry demands and standards that will enable UCLan Graduates to be better prepared to face global challenges.<br>\nThe Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), UK Employment Performance Indicator states that 93.9% of UCLan graduates are in employment or further study 6 months after graduating (source: www.hesa.ac.uk).Not only does a UCLan student receive comprehensive and industry-based knowledge, gather skills and tools but also on-hand work experience via the \u2018Internship/Industrial Placement\u2019 Year in their third year of the degree. The main objective of this Internship Year is to ensure that students gain hands-on experience from a variety of top companies in Sri Lanka, develop skills while further strengthening their resumes and importantly developing a career network that will bring them close to more opportunities in the future.<br>\nTo what extend is UCL committed to ensure that any student is not left behind at lectures?<br>\nUCL is committed to ensuring that students receive a high return on their investment in higher education. Thereby, the maximum number of students per batch is limited as our classroom sizes are small. This is deliberately designed to ensure that all students receive individual attention, interaction, guidance and mentoring from our panel of highly qualified lecturers. This is also a requirement by UCLan due to it being among the top 20 universities in UK for small group-centered teaching.<br>\nThis feature overcomes the problems of large classrooms in a typical college setting being similar to Tuition centers in Sri Lanka. Our panel of lecturers are highly qualified in their respective areas of expertise; 50% of them being PhD holders from top global universitiesand the rest with at least one Postgraduate qualifications aspiring to become PhD holders.In June 2017, UCLan was awarded the Silver Award by the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) for delivering high quality teaching, learning and outcomes for its students while consistently exceeding rigorous national quality requirements for UK higher education (source:http://www.hefce.ac.uk/reg/register/search/Provider/10007141)<br>\nAre scholarships awarded and is it only for academic qualifications?<br>\nScholarships/study grants up to 50% are offered for achievements in Academic, Leadership&amp; Extra-curricular activities.

Until I started my higher studies I didn\u2019t know that any other form of pain could exist and that the said pain too would need my attention.<br>\nEven though the times have changed,mental health issues are still a taboo and is given less or no importance at all. People are judged when they express their emotions like frustration, shame, guilt, and stress instead of being accepted. The fear of being judged and being questioned about their strength revert people to follow poor coping methods and to take drastic steps like committing suicide.<br>\nWhat would possibly give rise to stress and depression you might ask.A parent forcing the child to follow the bio stream in G.C.E. A/L because it would allow the child to do a \u201cprestigious\u201d occupation when the child wants to follow the Art stream because it\u2019s his passion would make the child stressed and eventually depressed.<br>\nA parent comparing the achievements of his/her child with the child\u2019s classmates when the child is proudly telling his or her achievements would make the child depressed. A friend telling a friend to brush the sadness off for it does not suit a man would ultimately lead to depression. These may seem simple and harmless but actually they could cause much harm which are severe and long lasting.<br>\nIs depression a real problem? Yes, it is. Depression is not imagined and the ones who suffer from depression are not attention seekers. The ones who commit suicide due to severe depression do not attempt to end their lives so that they could gain attention and sympathy from others.<br>\nWhen watching a western movie you might have come across people visiting therapists and instances where people are dealing with their emotions in constructive ways like maintaining a diary or turning their emotions in to art. But in Asian countries we are taught that silence and enduring is the way and this has to stop!<br>\nDepression is not just a personal matter anymore; rather it an economical and a social problem. A person suffering from depression won\u2019t be able to commit fully to the tasks given at work hence it would result in loss of productivity. Also absenteeism in work place would rise.<br>\nA depressed personnel might not at times pay attention to one\u2019s safety and will cause and face accidents in work place which would add to the health care costs of the organizations. Depression has become a social problem for depression will impair social relationships. Furthermore, a death by suicide would leave the family and friends guilty for they could think that \u201cthey should have known\u201d or \u201cshould have recognized suicide signs and pleas for help\u201d<br>\nWe as a nation, who take great pride in helping those who need, is still not late to initiate the task of providing help to people who have depression. We can start with raising awareness on what depression really is and how it differs from the daily stress we face.<br>\nAccording to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) depression is characterized by persistent sadness and a loss of interest in activities that a person normally enjoys accompanied by an inability to carry out daily activities for at least two weeks.<br>\nAlso it is important to make people aware that depression like any other illness could affect anyone at any age. WHO estimates that over 800,000 people suffer from depression in Sri Lanka but the figures would be much higher if we could reach out to rural areas as well.<br>\nI\u2019m not denying the great and successful efforts by Non-Government organizations in Sri Lanka like \u201cSumithrayo\u201d, :Samuttana\u201d, and ShanthiMaargam towards the betterment of mental health, but still in Sri Lanka mental health services tend to be urban centered.

Engineering is widely considered as one of the most lucrative and in demand career choices, with multiple engineering disciplines and job types, as well as salaries that can exceed US $100k per year once the engineer has some experience behind them.<br>\nEngineers tend to earn in excess of the national average salary and this is expected by some reputable organizations to continue in the future.(According Bureau of Labor Statistic USA) In fact, Engineering degrees make up 10 of the top 17 highest paid degrees globally.<br>\nWith engineering being a part of nearly all aspects of today\u2019s modern world, innovative thinkers who can solve problems will always be in demand, regardless of the specific discipline they studied in school. Moreover, it is not uncommon for an engineer to work in multiple disciplines over the course of their professional career. With that in mind, don\u2019t feel like you must choose a discipline based solely on the demand in that area right now. The fact that a particular discipline is in high demand right now does not guarantee that it will still be in high demand in 4-5 years when you are searching for your first job.<br>\nThe demand in particular areas of engineering (and thus salary levels) tends to have a cyclical trend; disciplines that are in high demand during one decade tend to become less attractive in the following years before \u201ccoming back\u201d into demand. The areas of engineering that are in most demand will also vary from country to country. In general, demand considerations should probably be secondary in your choice of field. Instead, give preference to what you are interested in and the kind of work you want to do.

{"content": "<p>Growing up in Sri Lanka pain always meant physical pain. I remember my mother applying ointments whenever I bruised my legs when I played with my siblings and cousins. If I had a fever my mother would constantly check my temperature and would take me to a doctor and I was allowed stay home without going to school. Until I started my higher studies I didn\u2019t know that any other form of pain could exist and that the said pain too would need my attention.<br>\nEven though the times have changed,mental health issues are still a taboo and is given less or no importance at all. People are judged when they express their emotions like frustration, shame, guilt, and stress instead of being accepted. The fear of being judged and being questioned about their strength revert people to follow poor coping methods and to take drastic steps like committing suicide.<br>\nWhat would possibly give rise to stress and depression you might ask.A parent forcing the child to follow the bio stream in G.C.E. A/L because it would allow the child to do a \u201cprestigious\u201d occupation when the child wants to follow the Art stream because it\u2019s his passion would make the child stressed and eventually depressed. A parent comparing the achievements of his/her child with the child\u2019s classmates when the child is proudly telling his or her achievements would make the child depressed. A friend telling a friend to brush the sadness off for it does not suit a man would ultimately lead to depression. These may seem simple and harmless but actually they could cause much harm which are severe and long lasting.<br>\nIs depression a real problem? Yes, it is. Depression is not imagined and the ones who suffer from depression are not attention seekers. The ones who commit suicide due to severe depression do not attempt to end their lives so that they could gain attention and sympathy from others.<br>\nWe as a nation, who take great pride in helping those who need, is still not late to initiate the task of providing help to people who have depression. We can start with raising awareness on what depression really is and how it differs from the daily stress we face. According to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) depression is characterized by persistent sadness and a loss of interest in activities that a person normally enjoys accompanied by an inability to carry out daily activities for at least two weeks. Also it is important to make people aware that depression like any other illness could affect anyone at any age. WHO estimates that over 800,000 people suffer from depression in Sri Lanka but the figures would be much higher if we could reach out to rural areas as well.<br>\nI\u2019m not denying the great and successful efforts by Non-Government organizations in Sri Lanka like \u201cSumithrayo\u201d, :Samuttana\u201d, and ShanthiMaargam towards the betterment of mental health, but still in Sri Lanka mental health services tend to be urban centered.<br>\nAfter understanding the need for and the value of mental health professionals in Sri Lanka, KIU commenced the Bachelors of Honours degree in Psychology. In this degree program we provide the students with the best of the education with the best of facilities as our aim is to produce responsible mental health professionals who would go the extra mile to ensure the wellbeing of their clients.<br>\nAn individual who would like to pursue a career in Psychology does not have to restrict himself just for a clinical setting by becoming a clinical psychologist; rather an individual has the opportunity to become an organizational/business psychologist, a health psychologist, an educational psychologist, a sports psychologist, a lecturer and many more professionals through which an individual could always help individuals with mental health issues.

{"content": "<p>Human Capital Management is viewed as a comprehensive \u201cpeople strategy\u201d that is integrated with the strategic management of the organization and takes a \u201cpeople as a strategic asset\u201d approach to business. In other words, people or employees are considered as the most important capital element of business organisation. Performance measurement, efficiency, engagement and the creation of value for the organization are the main focus areas of this concept. Horizon Campus approach to teaching business management blends well with the Human Capital Management concept. Horizon Campus views its students not just as customers but as assets of the nation that must nurtured and developed.<br>\nSimilarly, Human Capital Management views people and people development expenditures as \u201cinvestments\u201d in human capital rather than \u201ccosts.\u201d Thus, Human Capital Management approach sees employees as \u201ccapital assets\u201d of the organization, much like plant and equipment. While this may sound rather cold and impersonal to some people, in many respects it is just the opposite. It actually relates to, and gives the true meaning of the frequently repeated corporate mantra that \u201cour people are our greatest asset.\u201d The main premise of Human Capital concept is that people are the greatest asset and they should be managed as a strategic asset that contributes to the value creation.<br>\nAt Horizon Campus, the nation\u2019s most recognised university campus, we offer a four year honours degree which allows students to specialise in Human Resources. Our approach is a practice orientated approach where we expect the student to not just learn human resources management theory but we also train them in using that theory knowledge to build an implementable management toolkit which will help them to practice Human Capital Management. Horizon HR undergraduates would also take a gamut of other management subjects including finance, marketing, operations management, business mathematics and statistics which allows them to get a thorough grounding in all areas of business management.<br>\nModern corporate world have begun to embrace the Human Capital concept and view their employees as a serious investment. They are increasingly willing to spend a considerable amount of management time and organisational money on seeking out, attracting, training, keeping and effectively deploying best human assets they can find. As such it is important for graduates of Human Resources discipline to have an excellent understanding in all aspects of managing a business organisation so that they can truly appreciate how people in an organisation can create and capture value. This is where the Horizon Campus undergraduate degree rises above the rest. It is a four year, full time business degree with the final year dedicated to developing specialist skills in Human Resources and Human Capital Management.<br>\nTherefore, Horizon Campus HRM graduate is not a mere specialist in HR, but is someone who has developed the knowledge, aptitude and specific skill sets needed to be a fully fledged business executive. The philosophy of Horizon Campus is attuned to the vision of our founder, Mr. UpulDaranagama, the visionary entrepreneur behind Horizon Campus and the Horizon Group. Our philosophy, as outlined by Mr. Daranagama is not just to produce employable graduates, but to mold ethical minded young professionals who can thrive in the hyper competitive corporate world.<br>\nWith this vision in mind, Horizon Campus focuses in training our undergraduates to learn how to create value. Value is created when innovations that solve customer problems are designed and implemented. Groundbreaking, patentable, paradigm shifting innovations are certainly a boon to any employer, but they are hard to come by. However, in many organisations, above average value is created by simple innovations created by committed, observant employees. For an example, a seemingly insignificant innovation that reduces the time customers have to wait to be served by just a few minutes would boost not only customer satisfaction, but also the cumulative productivity of the customer service employees. Therefore, what makes the real difference in many firms are a number of incremental innovations such as above, created and implemented by committed, dedicated employees and allows a corporation to break forward and leave their competitors in the rear-view mirror.<br>\nIn order to deliver capable, driven and knowledgeable graduates who can create practical innovations to the corporate world, Horizon Campus undergraduate management programmes give the opportunity for a student to receive a six month internship during the third year of their four year honours management degree.<br>\nThis unique arrangement allows students to experience the corporate world for six months as full time employees and then return to campus to complete their specialisation in Human Resources Management. Our interns would be assigned to Human Resources departments of carefully selected corporations and would be tasked with assisting the Human Resources Managers of these organisations.<br>\nWith this unique programme structure, undergraduates of Horizon Campus receives real world exposure, working under practicing managers their compatriots in other programmes would not receive.<br>\n<strong>More information about Horizon Campus management degree programmes can be obtained at http://www.horizoncampus.edu.lkor contact; 071 3159159</strong></p>", "category": "Higher Education", "title": "Horizon Campus offers career paths towards Human Capital and Human Resources", "author": "Ajith Indrajeewa"},

Transfer students are guided step by step for a smooth transfer between colleges: students will learn everything about classes that best fit their needs, scholarship requirements, application procedures and deadlines in advance.<br>\nTransfer students enjoy a number of benefits such as learning from experts in their fields, cutting edge connections- most sophisticated smart classroom facilities and computer labs in the U.S.A., on-campus work options (20hrs a week), and 12/ 36 month work visa after graduation (Optional Practical Training program allows F-1 visa holders to work full-time in the US) besides their exposure to everything the great country has to offer. This unique opportunity is expected to transfer the lives of students as they find a way to adjust, adapt, and flourish: they become stronger during this process, learn new, transferable life skills, and recognize their potential for leadership and success, which in turn would help them launch truly global careers with leading companies.<br>\nDuring their stay at ANC, our students have access to a range of amenities and support services that enable them to be prepared to compete with their international counterparts in future. To illustrate this, in addition to regular classes, every student is encouraged to make the most of \u201coffice hours\u201d with the faculty.

It\u2019s used as a medicine to fight infections caused by bacteria in both humans and animals. Antibiotics are also a term amongst the most common phrases used in the Sri Lankan society. From mild cold to the most severe fever, locals consume antibiotics at their own discretion without prior consultation from a medical practitioner. When the world started to think it\u2019s much safer, the arrival of the mutated bacteria that become antibiotic-resistant turned the table around. These bacteria may infect humans and animals, and the infections they cause are harder to treat than those caused by non-resistant bacteria.<br>\nAntibiotic resistance is escalating to dangerously high levels throughout all parts of the world. New resistance mechanisms are emerging and spreading globally, threatening our ability to treat common infectious diseases. A growing list of infections \u2013 such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, blood poisoning and gonorrhea \u2013 are becoming harder, and sometimes impossible, to treat as antibiotics become less effective.<br>\nResearchers have discovered 76 previously unknown genes that make bacteria resistant to last-resort antibiotics. The genes were found while searching large volumes of bacterial DNA. The findings showed that several of these resistance genes can provide bacteria with the ability to degrade carbapenems \u2013 most powerful class of antibiotics used to treat multi-resistant bacteria.<br>\nThe next step for the research groups is to search for genes that provide resistance to other forms of antibiotics.

With the launch of the Global Engineering Transfer Programme in collaboration with ESIGELEC Graduate School of Engineering, one of the oldest and well reputed Engineering University in France, European Union, Sri Lankan students are offered multiple options in over 15 major areas of Engineering that can be partly completed in Sri Lanka and France with options to transfer to many universities in Europe, Australasia and North America.<br>\nAIC Campus, School of Engineering offers 2+3 Programme (Two Years in Sri Lanka at AIC Campus and 3 years in France ) to complete the only Integrated MSc in 12 Engineering Majors with Guaranteed paid internships in Europe during their studies at affordable costs.<br>\nAIC Campus also offers 2+2 programme In Engineering where students will complete their first two years in Sri Lanka and transfer to USA to complete the BSc in Engineering with over 20 Majors to select from.<br>\nPrashani Keshala Rodrigo, a former student of Lyceum International School, Wattala, who is studying at AIC Campus Global Engineering Transfer Programme major in Chemical Engineering / Energy Engineering shares her experience at AIC and the recently concluded tour of ESIGELEC France.<br>\nCan you share your school life experience?<br>\nI studied at Lyceum International School, Wattala and sat for my London A/Levels in 2016 in Math stream. I got through with 1A and 2B passes. I had a wonderful school career at Lyceum where I exceled in sports and extracurricular activities while focusing on studies. I was the Games Captain in 2014/2015, senior prefect of the School and was awarded the Most Outstanding Prefect of the year 2014/2015. I also played Basketball for Lyceum and Badminton where I won College colours for Basketball and represented the Gampaha District under 17 Basketball team in 2015. I was also an athlete and won events at the all Island level.<br>\nI also took part in Model United Nations and also held the position of Media Club General coordinator of Lyceum, Wattala. I was also an announcer and a compere at many School events.<br>\nI am proud that I studied at Lyceum International and the opportunities that were there for me to grow and develop my leadership skills and other skills while obtaining a good education, for which, I thank all my teachers and my parents who helped me with lots of understanding.<br>\nYou have chosen your higher education pathway in Chemical Engineering/Energy Engineering.<br>\nIf you ask me what was my dream job when I was in School I would say that I wanted to become a pilot. I always wanted to be different and try new things. However, during my time at the A/Levels, I developed a liking for Chemistry and I wanted to specialize in Chemistry first and then move on to either Energy Engineering or Petroleum Engineering.<br>\nThe field that I have selected has more scope around the world. I want to become highly specialized in my field and build a career and travel the world. One day I will be my own boss as I have this entrepreneurial spirit in me.<br>\nWhat do you want to achieve in life.<br>\nI am a person who always thinks that career goals are part of the life goals, but career is not going to be the objective of life. I look at it from a different point of view. I want to develop my career in the field that I love to be, that is Chemical, Energy and Petroleum Engineering that is to have a stable career and an income to achieve my life goals.<br>\nI want to launch a charity one day to help the needy not only in Sri Lanka but around the world where help and assistance is needed by vulnerable people. That is my goal in life.<br>\nWhy did you select France as final destination of study and ESIGELEC the University?<br>\nAs I mentioned earlier, I love to try new things and learn languages. France is one of the most developed countries in the world, second largest economy in the European Union and a G8 Nation. France has proven their prowess in the field of engineering in almost every field mainly Automotive, Aviation, Energy, Electrical and Electronics. Some of the top corporates and brands are French origin.<br>\nESIGELEC Graduate School of Engineering is over 115 years old and they have an impeccable record in producing quality and employable graduates throughout their history. Their partnership with the manufacturing industry and the research and development work carried out on behalf of major industries like Automobile, Automated Manufacturing and Energy is unbelievable.<br>\nConsidering all, I had no hesitation in selecting ESIGELEC in France to complete my MSc after the first two years at AIC in Sri Lanka.<br>\nWhy did you select the AIC Campus Global Engineering transfer program?<br>\nFor the first time students like me who wanted to be different were given the opportunity to join a transfer program which is the most affordable in the country. The two years in Sri Lanka and three years in France will give an MSc in Engineering field of my choice at a cost of one year or 3 semester cost of studying in traditional study destination which is a great relief. Most importantly, the quality of education standards is maintained as per European Union Regulations and the Paid internship opportunities during studies. I could not find a better option than this.<br>\nHow would you describe your experience at AIC Campus?<br>\nIf you prefer a short answer, I would say \u201cGreat\u201d. AIC Campus provides a real life university experience. We are fully involved with the academic as well as nonacademic work which helps us to build our character. We have a very vibrant student council in which I was the secretary last year (2016) and President this year. We organize and take part in sports, cultural festivals and parties.<br>\nI also have the privilege of meeting many new friends from Maldives and United Arab Emirates.<br>\nI also enjoyed the Visit to ESIGELEC France where my batch went along with the Chief Academic officer and spent some time at ESIGELEC and saw some of the modern labs and research work being done. I am looking forward to transfer to ESGELEC next fall.<br>\nWhat is your advice for students who wish to study Engineering?<br>\nDon\u2019t think engineering is difficult, nothing is difficult; nothing is hard as long as you are determined to achieve what you want to achieve. Look for a University that keeps evolving and innovative. There are many opportunities in countries such as France and European Union at a cost much lower than any traditional study destination.<br>\nI would like to thank AIC Campus for giving me this opportunity to explore a new country and a field of study. Their professionalism in student advising is unbelievably high.<br>\nIf you are determined to become an Engineer, there is no time to waste. Please call AIC Campus Engineering Transfer Programme on 0766 759 669/00779 779 776. You can start your engineering degree with pending A/Level results.</p>", "category": "Higher Education", "title": "Prashani Rodrigo, Future Energy  Engineer in the making", "author": "Ajith Indrajeewa"},

{"content": "<p>Professor Dr Shah Yasin, Head of School for the Jeffrey Cheah School of Medicine and Health Sciences (JCSMHS) at Monash Malaysia shares how medical students are prepared for the realities doctors face.<br>\nPrivate Hospital Engagement<br>\nFor the last three years, medical students at JCSMHS have had the opportunity to engage with private hospitals over the course of their undergraduate degree.<br>\n\u201cWe have a number of private hospitals which actively take our students. These include Sunway Medical Centre, which hosts the largest number of our students; Tropical Medical Centre; and the Darul Ehsan Medical Centre,\u201d shared Professor Shah.<br>\nIn private hospitals, students can tap into the knowledge of highly experienced specialists who have at least 10 years under their belt. Students have also shared that they have easier access to specialists, many of whom are keen teachers, at private hospitals.<br>\nIn comparison to public hospitals where you can see up to 40 patients in the morning, students may see less than 10 patients at a private hospital. Professor Shah explained that it is this leisurely pace which allows some time for specialists to address questions students may have. Additionally, both doctors and patients have also found students helpful. Students are able to assist doctors and specialists in various tasks, including sourcing for information from the latest journals.<br>\nOn top of that, student doctors have also been well received by patients. With hospitals being a lonely place for some patients, medical students often offer companionship, which helps with lifting patient moods, and subsequently improving patient wellbeing. Students also sometimes act as information bridges, when patients are reluctant to ask specialists questions. The response from private hospitals regarding the presence of medical students at the hospital has been encouraging. According to Professor Shah, following a survey that was conducted in the hospitals where students were posted for their pre-internship, the university found that not a single patient, to date, has refused to be seen by students.<br>\nPre-intern Posting<br>\nThe university\u2019s Year 5 program is essentially a pre-intern (ie pre-housemanship) year, but with additional academic requirements.\u201cThe program consists of six blocks, each lasting six weeks. Our students are attached to a consultant for each block,\u201d he explained.<br>\nStudents do these six pre-intern postings in different places, with two compulsory postings in Australia and four locally, including one in Segamat Hospital, Johor. While students are supposed to act and behave as interns, and do almost all the work of an intern, they do not yet take on the full responsibilities of an intern.<br>\nThese pre-intern postings gives them a taster as it expose them to various environments including the Australian healthcare system, a rural hospital, a private hospital and a large public hospital, such as the SultanahAminah Hospital, where they also need to complete a Patient Safety Module.<br>\nThe module is an important curriculum, which deals with the importance of ensuring the safety of patients \u2013 for example, the correct way of transporting critically ill patients.<br>\nThere is also another block on Indigenous Care, which focuses on the health of the indigenous people who have unique health issues and worse health outcomes compared to the general population. It is believed that there are many parallels in the social and health issues of indigenous people around the world.<br>\nIn Malaysia, students will also look into health issues of the Orang Asli, both in the hospital and through Orang Asli community visits during their pre-internship program.<br>\nProfessor Shah explained that rural hospitals differs vastly from public hospitals, as there are fewer services and specialists, making it important for students to acquire a broad range of experience to prepare them for this post.<br>\nThrough their holistic approach to education, Monash has produced well-rounded undergraduate medical students who have benefitted from learning a wide range of issues, including the healthcare system and work culture in Australia to the social determinants of health.<br>\nFor more information on the medical program at the Jeffrey Cheah School of Medicine and Health Sciences, at Monash University Malaysia, please visit www.med.monash.edu.my.</p>", "category": "Higher Education", "title": "The Importance of Training for Medical Students", "author": "Ajith Indrajeewa"},

{"content": "<p>What to study? This is very important as the course you select to follow and graduate should enable you to enter into a career in demand that will give you ample opportunities even internationally and give correct rewards and job satisfaction. Some of the skills that would lead to careers &amp; professions which would give excellent openings -ICT (specially cyber and network security, software engineering etc) Engineering (specially Robotics, Electronics, Environmental, Biomedical etc) Health Sciences ( Radiography, Optometry, Sonography, Orthotics and Prosthetics, Occupational therapy, Physiotherapy, Speech Pathology, Psychology, Medical Laboratory Science, Medicine, Vet Science, Dentistry etc), Commerce (specially Accounting, Actuary, Taxation, Auditing), Social Work, Nursing, Agriculture Sciences, Law, Hospitality (Culinary or Patisserie streams), Land and Building (Land Economy, Valuation, Architecture, Surveying, Quantity Survey, Cartography)<br>\nb. Which country to Study in? Study Abroad opportunities are available in most overseas countries. However your prime considerations should be whether \u2013 the country offering courses to international students consider it as an important agenda of it, the academics have excellent communication skills in English to offer comprehensive in depth knowledge, the universities are of high calibre, the country permit students to do part time work to earn living expenses, and the country officially offer the students to get post study work experience and if desired a chance to join the work force.<br>\nc. Which university to study in? All the established universities in the world are ranked based on many valid and critical criteria and these rankings are done by several well established independent bodies. The other factors to consider would be the course contents, accreditations to professional bodies for recognition, duration of the courses, the fee structure, location of campuses, the international students it caters to, the scholarships offered purely on merit available for high achievers etc. When it comes to post graduate studies the university selection is very vital as selecting a wrong university will jeopardise the entire future.<br>\nd. Cost of studies overseas? In a number of cases entry to certain professions need not have a degree from a top university or for that matter from a university per se. There are excellent degrees awarding polytechnics/ TAFE colleges whose degrees are highly recognised by employers. Therefore the selection of the university or institution should be based on the final outcome that is needed by considering\u2013 what is the profession to enter into<br>\ne. Pathway to study is also a vital consideration. Students who do not have A/L results for direct entry to a university must select a pathway course \u2013 a Foundation, a diploma or a university year course. There are courses of same duration or a marginally longer period but at a much reduced cost \u2013 starting from AUD 15,000 in Australia to NZD 18,000 in New Zealand.<br>\nConsidering all above factors choosing to study in Australia or New Zealand is one of the best choices.

{"content": "<p>When it comes to the field of communications and media studies, what does having a Master\u2019s degree make you an expert of? It is a question worth mulling over for anyone who is considering pursuing futher education. After all, deciding on a post-graduate degree is a big decision. Forget the potential promotion, pay rise, and prestige that comes with having a Master\u2019s degree. Enrolling in a Master programme is a conscious decision to become an expert in something. If you are unclear about that, you should not be doing a Master\u2019s. Dr Tan MengYoe, coordinator for the Master in Communication and Media Studies program in the School of Arts and Social Sciences, Monash Malaysia explains.<br>\nThe Master of Communication and Media Studies (MCMS) at Monash University Malaysia gives you the skill to identify, unpack, and deconstruct communication processes and networks that societies require to function. In short, it makes you an expert in cultural research. It does not sound fancy, but it makes practical sense in the increasingly globalised society that we live in today. Media and communications professionals, such as journalists, filmmakers, corporate communications professionals, and more, are often already experts in their technical craft by the time they consider enrolling in a Master\u2019s program.<br>\nThe real step up is the development of advanced critical thinking, exposure to a more diverse range of knowledge, and the ability to conduct quality research in order to raise the level of media content, management process, business insights, or any communications roles that one is involved in.<br>\nCritical Thinking<br>\nCritical thinking, on the basic level, refers to the ability to objectively analyse any issue to develop an informed opinion on it. We are all by nature biased, and it takes discipline and practice to be truly informed. An example of this is to think of the type of news that we consume. If our habit is to exclusively seek out news that conforms to our pre-existing worldview, that is a bias that restricts our capacity to juggle multiple perspectives and analyse deeper layers of meaning.<br>\nWithout the willingness to engage with our own biases and consider alternative approaches to data, we become echo chambers, hearing only what we want to hear. This is detrimental to any individual as it leads to intellectual complacency. Here, we provide the tools to break that habit. New theoretical ideas about media and society are taught and applied to real world case studies in order to sharpen our ability to objectively identify issues and solve problems creatively.<br>\nNew Knowledge<br>\nCritical thinking is important, but it can only happen when there is something to think about. New knowledge is always necessary. Students learn and share the latest trends and developments in the media and communications industry, and are exposed to a wide range of contemporary issues that has implications on everyday life in the Asian region. Students are encouraged to learn about cultures beyond their own, to broaden understanding of the world we live in. This accumulation of knowledge is a valuable resource.<br>\nAll of this is facilitated not just by the lecturers and the curriculum, but also by the diverse student cohort. Because our students come from different professional backgrounds and are represented by people from various nationalities, it is an opportunity to learn from each other\u2019s cultural and career experiences. Learning to work together in this environment is a lesson in itself. In short, the spirit of learning is actively cultivated here.<br>\nResearch Skills<br>\nContemporary issues are not just gleaned through reading about global events in the news, but through active research by both teacher and student. Research is a crucial skill to have. Learning to gather information, analyse it, and synthesise it into knowledge that can be applied into everyday life is an advantageous skill to have.<br>\nThe lecturers in the program are all research active in a wide variety of areas \u2013 social media, communications, urban anthropology, politics and international relations, and more.<br>\nHaving good teachers with years of teaching experience is not enough. Our scholars are actively producing new knowledge and can pass on advanced skills in conducting relevant research.<br>\nThis provides students with the skills required to develop expertise in their respective fields of work through rigorous, critical, and insightful research.<br>\nWe often hear that good study programs are all about being job ready, relevant to the 21st century, collaborative, internationally recognised, and more.<br>\nThe MCMS program at Monash University Malaysia not only has these elements, but synergises them to create a learning environment where one can develop holistically in every area.</p>", "category": "Higher Education", "title": "What Does Expertise in Media and  Communication Mean?", "author": "Ajith Indrajeewa"},

It didn\u2019t take long for this bright and bubbly teenager to adapt to college life and excel in her studies, for ANC ensures a smooth transition from O level to university level study for any student who joins ANC.<br>\nAbove all, Yadurshini was prepared to succeed: \u201cOpportunities don\u2019t get dished to us on a silver platter, your success is based on your how much you want it,\u201d says Yadurshini who graduated from the University of Albany (SUNY) last year to land a lucrative career as a research coordinator attached to the Cornell University, one of the most prestigious universities in the world, at the age of 21! She is grateful to ANC for directing her in the correct path to achieve her higher education dreams, which in turn propelled her towards her career goals. ANC congratulates Yadurshini on her accomplishments!<br>\nYadurshini discusses how ANC ensured a seamless transition from O levels to undergraduate level studies in the US, whereas the University of Albany inspired her to reach her fullest potential:<br>\nJoining ANC in spring 2013<br>\nSoon after I finished my O levels, I was eager to go to college. Like most of my friends, I had that irresistible desire to pursue my higher education in the USA; nevertheless, I wanted to be back home for a while after a long period of time spent in Singapore. I returned to Sri Lanka to be enrolled on US Transfer Program offered by ANC, which had continued to gain stature as the only place where you could have access to the same standard of education as practiced in America.<br>\nFreshman life at ANC<br>\nUS colleges require you to take a wide variety of General Education classes. It was at ANC I completed my General Education program designed for all undergraduate students regardless of major. We had classes in several subjects, such as, Math, English Composition, History, IT, Natural Sciences, Sociology, World Literature, etc., so by the time I was prepared to transfer I had already been exposed to the US education system, learned about US culture, and improved several skills including writing and critical thinking skills, presentation skills, computing and quantitative skills necessary to succeed in college. All these courses were delivered by dynamic faculty in an interactive setting.<br>\nThe experiences ANC students have outside of the classroom are also wonderful: opportunities for involvement include several student clubs and societies. I was the president of the Performance Arts Club in 2014. It was a one-of-a-kind experience which enabled me to work with an amazing group of friends who were there for one another to find the right balance between academics and extra curriculars. All in all, we had fun while maintaining near-perfect grades.<br>\nTransferring to the University at Albany I had earned 80 academic credits at ANC, and almost all the credits got transferred to UAlbany. Thanks to ANC\u2019s US Transfer division, it was a hassle free process. Ms Manouri, the Head of US/ Canada University Placement Program, attends to everything from one-on-one meetings with the student and parents to discussions with representatives from US universities and embassy to college and visa applications to ensure a positive acceptance. After all, ANC had worked in close collaboration with several universities in the SUNY system for more than a decade, so everything went off without a hitch.<br>\nStudent life at UAlbany<br>\nIt\u2019s a world of opportunities available in America for any student determined to succeed. Located in New York\u2019s capital, University of Albany was indeed an attractive option. Named one of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Top Colleges\u201d by Forbes, Albany offers students abundant opportunities of a comprehensive public research university. It propelled me towards my career goals. I double majored in Biology and Human Biology while taking on a minor in English. I also got the opportunity to work as an undergraduate research assistant for a Molecular Biology lab, as a student assistant for the Athletic department, besides working for the Global Institute for Health and Human Rights, an NGO involved in raising awareness of the intersection between health and human rights with emphasis on reproductive health, maternal and childcare, HIV/ AIDS. This was such an eye opening experience that triggered my interest in humanitarian action.<br>\nI worked with a number of scholars from world renowned universities including Harvard and Oxford. Some of them shared in first hand experiences of the issues discussed and challenged us to reach the fullest potential. This invaluable experience combined with strong academics led me to land a rewarding career as a research coordinator at the Cornell University upon graduation. I\u2019m currently working on a research project carried out in Mumbai: it\u2019s a study focusing on malnourished children in the slums of Mumbai.<br>\nMessage for prospective students<br>\nFrom my vantage point now, I can see that I made one of the most important decisions in my life at the age of 16-to go to college right after O levels. That was the crucial choice and I wasn\u2019t even aware of it. It was an enriching experience after all. I took on two majors in addition to a minor in English.<br>\nI had done three jobs by the time I graduated last year. I have met amazing people throughout my academic career. I\u2019m grateful to everything/ everyone that made me who I am today. You have enormous choices; you have to discipline your own time. If you are motivated and committed, you can achieve great things at any age. Hard work always pays off.

New and emerging technologies have challenged the traditional process of teaching and learning. Mobility is currently the next great movement in the workplace, and students who use technology in the classroom today will be more adapted to using it in the future. Therefore learning how to use a computer and it\u2019s programs has become essential in today\u2019s context as a necessary job skill.<br>\nThe Government is also now encouraging every school to offer Computer learning as a part of their curriculum.However, despite the positive trends towards adopting technology in the classroom, it is still not universally available to students in all schools, with many schools struggling to havea computer lab due to it\u2019s high cost and maintenance.<br>\nSpeaking of this existing gap and the measures taken by Saegis to assist those students who have not had an education of computer learning in school the Founder and Chairman of Saegis Campus Mr. BandaraDissanayake said \u201cwhilst we understand the challenge that many schools undergo in having computer learning offered in the classroom , we at Saegis strongly believe that students in our country need to have and develop a passion and a proficiency for information technology, that will not only help them in their future careers but will also open up many opportunities for them in the IT industry. Therefore, it is with such a vision that we have designed and launched a dual certificate in IT and English for those school leavers with no computer education, to gain a solid foundation and the basic understanding they will need on which to build their future knowledge and skill with computers.\u201d<br>\nAccording to Mr.Bandara, the course gives students an understanding of the principals and basic theories of business and information technology, develops capabilities necessary to effectively use information technology andincludes an introduction to computer programming. It also introduces students to managing files and folders, the Internet, Microsoft word, excel, power point and gives them an introduction to email and its features and shows them how to personalize their computers.<br>\nHe further explained \u201cwhile these skills might seem obvious at first, studying them now, will both save time later and also improve their daily computer productivity.\u201d<br>\nIn addition to the course offered, their dedicated lecturer panel will help with any class work difficulties, making up missed classes and other computer related problems.<br>\nAdditionally,an English course that covers the normal day to day conversational skills required in business and written communicationis also offered. The course is also structured into 4 different sections each that will emphasize on developing English speaking, pronunciation, listening, reading &amp; writingskills .All the lessons are created in a step-by-step method, starting with the easiest words, easiest grammar points, and easiest sentences, and then slowly introducing harder words to make it easier to learn.Visual aids, audio files, and speaking practice sections will be used to help every type of learner.<br>\nBy offering this dual certificate in IT and English, the mission of Seagis as a premier higher education institute, is that of harnessing better computer literacy amongst the students in the country,which will in turn lead the way towards a more a tech savvy generation of young adults .</p>", "category": "Higher Education", "title": "SAEGIS Campus Offers Dual Certificate   in IT and English After O/Ls", "author": "Ajith Indrajeewa"},

The 2+3 program has given many Sri Lankan students to achieve their engineering dream at a very affordable cost and career opportunities in European Union and worldwide.<br>\nWhen you think about countries with top engineering programs, US, Switzerland or China may be the first to come to your mind. However there are many other nations offer premiere engineering opportunities with allures of their own. One destination topping the list for engineers in search for an international education is none other than France. Let\u2019s take a closer look at top reasons to consider France as your destination to study engineering.<br>\nFrench Engineering Degrees are Highly Esteemed<br>\nFrench engineering programs are well-known for their rigorous curricula aimed at positioning graduates for successful careers following graduation. France\u2019s selective Grandes Ecoles d\u2019Ing\u00e9nieur fuse advanced theoretical concepts with practical applications, such as small workshop sessions and paid internships. They also integrate business training, foreign language study, and communication skills, all teaching Undergraduates to deliver creative solutions to some of today\u2019s most complex challenges.<br>\nStanding behind today\u2019s French engineering degrees is The Engineering Title Committee (CTI), the monitoring body tasked with ensuring the ongoing excellence of the country\u2019s engineering education system.<br>\nLearn in a Culture of Ages- old Engineering Innovations<br>\nNeed more proof of the strength of French engineering programs and the capabilities of their grads? Just take a quick look at the country\u2019s legacy of engineering innovation, starting with the TGV (Train \u00e0 Grande Vitesse or \u201chigh-speed train\u201d). World record holder for speed, the TGV is considered to be a technological marvel for its combination of performance, comfort, and commitment to eco-mobility.<br>\nAnd the TGV is hardly alone. The 17th century, 150-mile Canal du Midi which spans from Toulouse to the port of S\u00e8te in the Mediterranean is so extraordinary in both vision and execution that it\u2019s earned Unesco World Heritage Site status.<br>\nAnd of course no discussion of feats of European engineering is complete without mention of the Eurotunnel. A joint project of France and the UK, the Channel Tunnel took more than 13,000 workers and five years to complete, and has since been declared to be one of the seven wonders of the modern world.<br>\nWhat does each of these have in common aside from their impressive engineering schemes? They were considered unthinkable until French engineers put their minds to the task. In fact recently France topped all other European Nations for innovations based on the Thomson Reuters round up of top 100 Global Innovators.<br>\nThe French Language Adds Value<br>\nWhile the importance of knowing English is widely touted, the value of bilingualism is often understated. But as globalization continues to break down conventional barriers to communication, knowledge of a second or more language adds irrefutable value.<br>\nIn addition to enhancing a student\u2019s ability to communicate, studying French also affords students otherwise unattainable access to understanding French culture and context. These cross-cultural capabilities serve graduates well \u2014 both when working alongside other French speakers as well as when communicating with other international students, as well.<br>\nIt is France After all<br>\nMere mention of the word \u201cFrance\u201d makes most people swoon. While engineering programs are indeed demanding, you won\u2019t spend all your time studying. When you\u2019re not hitting the books, France offers an abundance of unforgettable things to see and do and taste and discover.<br>\nAnd while Paris may get the entire buzz, there are plenty of other phenomenal French cities for international students, such as the European metropolis of Lyon. A major technological, industrial and economic hub.<br>\nFrance is known for many things \u2014 from breathtaking art to fabulous food. It\u2019s not a surprise that this prominent country also shines in other areas as well, such as engineering. Prospective engineers in search of high-quality international engineering educational opportunities will find that and so much more in this legendary, romantic and innovative country.<br>\nAIC Campus Engineering Transfer Program to France<br>\nAIC Campus Engineering Transfer to France allows students to study two years in Sri Lanka and Transfer to ESIGELEC Graduate School of Engineering to complete their MSc in 14 major areas of study. Some of the Majors are Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Telecommunications Engineering, Network Architecture and security, Robotics, Mechatronics, Biomedical Systems, Electronics systems for auto and aerospace engineering etc.<br>\nIf you are after you\u2019re a/Levels and looking forward to become a qualified engineer in a dream specialization AIC Campus can provide you the opportunity to study your engineering degree at an affordable cost.

{"content": "<p>Genetics is a field of biology that studies genes, heredity, and genetic variation. Genetic variation includes how genes become changed from their original state (mutated) or are involved in disease and aging. A knowledge of genetics is fundamental to an understanding of how organisms, populations, and species evolve.<br>\nThe father of genetics is Gregor Mendel, a late 19th-century scientist and Augustinian friar. Classical or Mendelian genetics started with Mendel\u2019s studies of the nature of inheritance in plants. Later in the twentieth and early 21st century, genetics advances were geared toward the molecular level, and the dawn of the information age brought about modern genomics science as it is known today.<br>\nThe field of genetic engineering, or modifying the DNA of organisms, emerged in 1972 when the first altered molecule of DNA was constructed as \u201crecombinant DNA. The field of biology that studies the structure and function of genes at a molecular level and thus employs methods of both molecular biology and genetics is known as Molecular Genetics. With the involvement of technological advances, a milestone was set by sequencing the genome of a human conducted by the Human Genome project team. With such advances in genetics and technology, scientists now have the capacity to identify some of the genes which interact with other genes and the environment to cause disease or other health effects. Technologies such as gene therapy came into play with over 2000 genetic tests available for human conditions.<br>\nBy being a geneticist, you will be having access to latest development in Medical as well as in other disciplines. Geneticists apply their knowledge for purposes such as treating and counseling patients with hereditary conditions, as well developing of pharmaceutical and agricultural products.<br>\nThe Basic steps of being a geneticist are to obtain a bachelor\u2019s degree in biology, biotechnology (if offered) or a closely related field. Though there are associate degrees in biology that will form a firm foundation for the bachelor\u2019s, most entry-level positions in genetics will require at least a bachelor\u2019s degree.

{"content": "<p>The Intelligent Lighting Laboratory at Monash University Malaysia is at the forefront of developing human-centric lighting systems that enhance user experience and well-being. Research at the intelligent lighting lab is multifaceted and cuts across different disciplines such as Engineering, Information Technology, Science, Medicine and Psychology. Students of the Bachelor of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering (ECSE) program have the option of selecting a research-led elective in the field of Solid State Lighting which taps on the infrastructure at this lab.<br>\nDr Vineetha Kalavally, Director of the lab, said \u201cLighting has evolved from bulbs serving the basic purpose of providing light to intelligent systems that can do far more.\u201d<br>\nOne active area of research that is being supported by the lab is on the non-visual effects of light. Associate Professor Tan Chee Pin, Discipline Head (Mechatronics), School of Engineering, Monash University Malaysia explained: \u201cLight was traditionally used to perceive brightness and color of objects which are closely related to the human vision. However, now it has been found that specific parts of the light spectrum affect the human body in terms of our sleep-wake cycle in an unrelated manner.\u201d<br>\n\u201cIt has been known for very long that light is an important stimuli to our circadian rhythm which regulates the sleep-wake cycle. But nowadays, the average person spends far more time indoor, under artificial lights than outdoor.Hence there is a need to design better lighting systems based on a sound understanding of the impact of light on human well-being. Research employing psychophysical tests and EEGs is a good start to learning how our brain responds to different types of light\u201d, added Dr Vineetha.<br>\nThis work is done in collaboration with the Neurobusiness Lab and the Department of Psychology at the Jeffrey Cheah School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Monash University Malaysia. \u201cThe questions being asked are, if there is the potential for lights to alter alertness and cognition in human beings, to correct the circadian disruption of night-shift workers and frequent travellers, to prevent ICU patients from becoming delirious, to mention just a few\u201d, AssocProf Tan remarked.<br>\nAnother application of LED lights that is gaining popularity is the usage of lights for communication. \u2018LiFi\u2019 is the new buzzword in optical wireless communication and research has shown that it can definitely complement and may even replace WiFi in the future. The intelligent lighting lab focuses on combining illumination and communication quality of LiFi.<br>\n\u201cLEDs lend themselves easily to electronic switching and control as opposed to traditional lights, and because of that, you can put data on your lights. Lights could thus serve a dual purpose \u2013 communication,\u201d said Dr Vineetha.<br>\nSeveral students at Bachelors, Masters and PhD level of the ECSE program are currently involved in the research and development of Intelligent Lighting Systems.<br>\nA wearable device that measures a person\u2019s circadian lux exposure which is the light power that affects the circadian rhythm, is currently being developed by students in the final year of ECSE. This is an effort in collaboration with the Monash Institute of Cognitive and Clinical Neurosciences at Monash University Australia. This device can be potentially worn by several groups of people such as shift workers, people under special medication, frequent travellers, young adults, elderly, patients in hospitals etc. In order to measure their typical exposures with the aim of mapping it to their psychological and physiological status. The results are expected to provide valuable insights to aid not just lighting design, but also formulation of standards and governmental policies and consumer behavior.<br>\n\u201cWe are going to measure the spectrum of the light with the device we have designed. Light is the most important synchroniser for the circadian clock that we have in our brain. So what we are going to measure is how much circadian lux the subject is exposed to over a period of time, and back up this data periodically on a cloud for researchers to access,\u201d said Hassan Mohamed,an ECSE undergraduate currently working on the development of the device.Another upcoming area of research is horticultural lighting, where lights are designed to enhance the growth of plants, and is performed in collaboration with the School of Science.<br>\n\u201cThis research focuses on how LED lights with specially designed spectra could be used to enhance bioactivities in plants thus leading to better pharmacological benefits\u201d explained Assoc Prof Tan.<br>\nFor more information on the research and training facilities at the Intelligent Lighting Laboratory, School of Engineering, please visit https://www.monash.edu.my/engineering/research/infrastructure/intelligent-lighting-laboratory</p>", "category": "Higher Education", "title": "More to Light Than You Can See\u2026", "author": "Ajith Indrajeewa"},

For instance, she has been the President of The Hospitality Club and she has been getting several career opportunities as well, and we are very proud of her and extremely grateful for ANC for paving the way for my daughter to climb up the ladder and be a great leader.\u201d<br>\nMr Mohamed Asif,Chief Operating Officer,V-Media-Maldives<br>\n\u201cMy son, Enuka De Silva (past student of Dharmashoka College), has continued his higher studies at ANC with great enthusiasm, while maintaining a very satisfactory GPA since he joined ANC in fall 2016 after his A levels. We wish we enrolled him on ANC\u2019s Northwood Business program right after his O levels, which could have enabled him to graduate two years early. The support given to ANC students to thrive in their intended field of study is commendable. Their curriculums are up-to-date and industry-relevant; it\u2019s a winning combination of outstanding academics and professional skills-a mix that\u2019s particularly appealing in today\u2019s economic reality. \u201d<br>\nDr Radika Sugathapala, General Practitioner- Ambalangoda<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m the proud father of Kalani Jayasekara (past student of OKI International), who is currently studying for an Associate Degree (A.S) at ANC Education following the U.S. Transfer Program. Enrolling her to ANC was a wise decision and I\u2019m highly satisfied with her improved performance ever since she joined. I very much appreciate the quality education she receives from ANC with a well-qualified panel of lecturers, and the support given by the management and the Student Affairs Office is invaluable. This can be proven by the fact that she has been able to maintain a GPA above 3.0 throughout. Also the education exhibitions conducted takes a prominent place in deciding the prospective university the students expect to join in order to continue their education in USA.

Although university education in Sri Lanka is an aspiration to many, it is a dream realized only by a few.

The ODL methodology is based on self-study and independent learning where distance learners assume responsibility to initiate a self-directed learning experience. Regular lectures, a feature of face-to-face teaching at a conventional university, is minimal at the OUSL. Instead, students learn through carefully prepared study material together with other forms of support that facilitate learning. In addition to gaining subject knowledge and skills, students develop many other life skills, including self-organization and time management. The OUSL opens pathways to pursue university level education for all prospective students, young or old, in Colombo or in the peripheries.<br>\nDegrees awarded by the OUSL are equal to those awarded by any other national university in Sri Lanka and is recognized internationally as well.
